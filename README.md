# GO_player_based_on_alpha_beta_search
Created a GO playing agent for a 5*5 board based on alpha beta search.
The agent reads previous board and current board from input.txt file and writes the best move in output.txt file.
The game continues until both the players make a total of 24 moves or either of the player makes a wrong move.
